# AI Usage Report

### Purpose of AI Assistance

AI assistance was used during the development of this project to:  
- Improve the **structure and readability** of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.  
- Receive guidance on **Bootstrap 5** usage and responsive layout design.  
- Implement **dynamic content fetching** from the GitHub API.  
- Create and refine **form validation** logic using JavaScript.  
- Improve **light/dark mode** functionality and CSS class organization.  
- Generate professional documentation, including this **README.md** and `ai-usage-report.md`.  
- Suggest efficient **sorting and filtering logic** for projects.  
- Advise on **localStorage usage** to remember returning users and preferences.

### Tools Used

The following AI tool was used:  
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4/5)**  

The AI tool was used exclusively as a **coding assistant** and **documentation helper**.  
All code, layout adjustments, and design decisions were **reviewed, tested, and finalized** by me.

### Specific AI Contributions

| Category | AI Contribution | Human Review |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| HTML Structure | Suggested improvements for layout, Bootstrap grid usage, and inline form design. | Manually reviewed and adjusted for responsive behavior and alignment. |
| CSS Styling | Assisted in writing color themes, dark mode transitions, spacing, and Flexbox adjustments. | Verified visually and customized to match portfolio branding. |
| JavaScript Logic | Generated fetch logic for GitHub API, form validation, theme toggle, and timer. | Reviewed, tested in browser, and adjusted for correctness, efficiency, and user experience. |
| Markdown Documentation | Suggested structured README.md and AI usage report layout. | Proofread, edited, and finalized all content. |
| Debugging | Provided advice on error handling, DOM manipulation, and browser compatibility. | Implemented solutions and verified functionality locally. |
| Sorting & Filtering | Suggested project filtering by topic and sorting by newest/oldest/A–Z. | Modified sorting placement and logic to avoid performance issues. |
| localStorage Usage | Recommended storing user preferences and visitor names for personalization. | Adjusted code to handle data correctly and display personalized greetings. |

### What the AI Did *Not* Do

- The AI did **not** write the entire project autonomously.  
- The AI did **not** make design or content decisions independently.  
- The AI did **not** perform testing, deployment, or debugging without my verification.  
- The AI did **not** implement user interactions or ensure responsive layout—these were handled manually.

### Benefits of AI Assistance

- **Time-saving:** Provided initial code and logic suggestions, reducing development time.  
- **Learning aid:** Demonstrated best practices and coding patterns for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
- **Error reduction:** Helped avoid common mistakes in API fetch calls, DOM manipulation, and validation logic.  
- **Documentation support:** Enabled consistent, professional Markdown formatting and clear instructions.

### Challenges Encountered

- Needed to adjust AI-suggested sorting logic which was initially applied inside loops incorrectly.  
- Correct handling of localStorage values required manual fixes.  
- Flexbox and responsive layout suggestions needed fine-tuning for mobile devices.

### Learning Outcomes

- Improved skills in **JavaScript DOM manipulation** and **event handling**.  
- Gained experience with **REST API integration** (GitHub API).  
- Learned effective **state management** using localStorage.  
- Developed ability to **modify AI-generated code responsibly**, ensuring functional, efficient, and user-friendly behavior.
